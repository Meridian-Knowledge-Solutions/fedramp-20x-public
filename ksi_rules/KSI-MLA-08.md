# KSI-MLA-08: Protect audit logs to support after-the-fact investigations

## Overview

**Category:** Monitoring, Logging, and Auditing
**Status:** Not validated

**What it validates:** Protect audit logs to support after-the-fact investigations

**Why it matters:** Validates a multi-layered log protection strategy, including log integrity (CloudTrail), long-term retention and encryption (CloudWatch, KMS), and restricted access (IAM RBAC).

## Validation Method

1. `aws cloudtrail describe-trails --output json`
   *Validate the integrity and encryption of the primary audit log source (CloudTrail).*

2. `aws logs describe-log-groups --output json`
   *Check CloudWatch Logs for evidence of long-term, compliance-grade retention.*

3. `aws iam list-roles --output json`
   *Check for specialized IAM roles that enforce least privilege for log access.*

4. `aws kms list-keys --output json`
   *Verify that KMS keys are available for encrypting logs at rest.*
